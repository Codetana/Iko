##PDO conversion from MySQLi
This branch is dedicated to converting the current MySQLi-dependent framework to a PDO-dependent framework for a wider variety of database choices for administrators to go into.

###Progress
Currently, the conversion is still in development and still contains *many* unconverted codes and is *not* recommended for production use.

###Eventuality
This branch will eventually merge with the master branch for full support of the PDO version over the MySQLi.

###API Changes?
We will also be updating the API consistently throughout the update of this branch with the goal of making the code more secure and load with lesser time.
